# Chat-LTU
This is a chatbot project for the course [D7058E](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/D70/D7058E/D7058E-Text-Mining-1.194444) at Luleå Univeristy of Technology. We try to implement something similar to [Instruct-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) or [Chat-GPT] mostly based on the papers and the [rlhf blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) from Huggingface.

## Todo: 
- Implement [PPO2](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo2.html) for faster RL fine-tuning. 
- Implement the website that is partially done to gather real human data.
- Upload reward model and fine-tuned model to Huggingface for open source use.
